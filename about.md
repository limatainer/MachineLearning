<h1>The Machine Learning Calculation</h1>
</br>
<h3>This will essentially predict a value obtained by the historical results from the past years regarding NPS</h3>
</br>
<p>You will be able to have the <strong>total NPS </strong>for a future week based on the inputs you submit on this app</p>
</br>
<h3> Calculating the NPS</h3>
</br>
<p>This is a <strong>Machine Learning</strong> that uses Time Series Linear Regression and will be your tool so you can use weeklly to be able to get the forecast for the total NPS and if necessary antecipate coachings or team strategies
You will see that after you hit the 'predict' button it will show you 4 lines each one based on the week you selected plus the future 3 weeks in sequence</p>

<h2> How does Machine Learning works?</h2>
<p>Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that teaches computers to think in a similar way to how humans do: Learning and improving upon past experiences. It works by exploring data and identifying patterns, and involves minimal human intervention</p>
</br>
<p>Almost any task that can be completed with a data-defined pattern or set of rules can be automated with machine learning. This allows companies to transform processes that were previously only possible for humans to performâ€”think responding to customer service calls, bookkeeping, and reviewing resumes</p>
